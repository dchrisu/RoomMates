# RoomMates
## Have you ever had the issue where you could not remember **who paid** for **what**?
## Don't you wish there was an **easy way** to keep track of **payments** between **roommates**?

Well the solution is here! I created this app in mind to do the following:
1. Keep track of local users
1. Track payment history through a minimum of maybe 4-8 clicks
1. Have a one-button solution to automatically calculate and sort "who owes what" whenever you need it

Created in Kotlin, using Android Studio.
